This is a Medical Scanner application for the Strepiny LARP.

I would hereby like to thank Anna Kruglik and Serge Zaitsev for creating and sharing a OBSQR application which serves as a base for this application. OBSQR is availabe here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=trikita.obsqr&hl=en .
The OBSQR itself is based on the ZBAR library, which is available here: http://zbar.sourceforge.net/about.html and I would also like to thank its creators.
